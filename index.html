        <p>Hi my name is Hershyl and I am from Auckland, New Zealand. I have a wife and three young children under the age of five. They are my favorite people to be around becuase they are very entertaining!
            I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music and through this enjoyment I was able to teach myself how to play the piano/keyboard by ear. I love to watch and play sport, mostly contact sport like Rugby, Football, Boxing and Basketball.
            I love to cook outdoors such as barbeques or in my culture(Samoa) we have a traditional way of cooking which is 'umu' or an earth oven style of cooking.
            I have a great fascination for the scriptures especially the Book of Mormon. I admire the stars and planets in the within and outside of our Solar system because, to me, they are a witness of God's eternal power and majesty.
            I find my greatest moments of peace when I am outdoors, admiring the natural beauty of the earth. I believe that the family was designed by God for us to experience joy and laughter and to feel safe, loved and supported.
            If I had one of my many wishes granted, it would be that everyone person born into this Earth would be born into a loving and happy family.

        <p>The Māori are the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand. Although New Zealand is a civilized country, the Maori culture and language is well respected and celeberated by all the locals. As an honored guest or visitor to New Zealand, you can expect to be welcomed by a 'powhiri'(welcoming party) where you will witness a great 'haka'(traditional war dance/cry). A unique way that traditional Maori people greet is by 'hongi', which is where people press their noses together and breathe in or exchange breath.</p>
